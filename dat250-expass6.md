- Technical difficulties
 
There were several minor issues from the previous hand-in which made a basis for complications during the continuation.
The first part was going back an improving the backend logic (controllers and entities), and expanding to achieve the 
necessary CRUD-operations that were required. 

There wasn't really that many issues with this tutorial. The most critical was perhaps the connection between the frontend and the backend.
I encountered several issues with the serialization and converting from and to objects.


- Pending issues

There are probably several improvements that could have been made to make the application more "safe" from abuse and correct.
The main requirements described in the tutorial are however covered sufficiently. Some of the requests might still have some bugs as there was 
a focus on the creating a poll and casting a vote during this exercise. So there is potentially room for improvements there.
